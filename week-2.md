# Monday:
On Monday we began by looking at various different types of web based vulnerabilities and how they worked. We were also given the task of researching and write about bug bounties and responsible disclosure policies. I started my search by looking at some of the most common bug bounty platforms such as dvuln, bug crowd and hackerone. While the responsible disclosure policy varied between platform and organization they all mentioned that once vulnerability was found it must be immediately reported and it can’t be shared or discussed with others. These rules are put in place so that the organization has time to patch the issue prior to it being disclosed and to limit the chances of a malicious actor becoming aware of it prior to it being patched. Each of the organizations participating in the bug bounty program also outlined their own scope that informed which parts of the organizations systems were part of the bug bounty program. The scope often focused on only including the most recent products or services rather than those no longer being serviced as well as excluding any areas that could contain company secrets or other sensitive information.

# Tuesday:
On Tuesday I attempted to break into a machine on hack the box, I did this because from the beginning I had outlined that one of my goals was to be able to break into machines from hack the box so I wanted to try and get a better understanding of the steps involved. I decided to attempt the ypuffy retired machine as (due to it being a retired machine) documentation and guides were published that I can follow to learn about how to break the machine and of the two retired machines that were accessible to me as a free user ypuffy was rated as being lower in difficulty. 

Unfortunately I started having difficulty breaking into the box fairly early on and I was unable to make any substantial progress so I decided to continue by following along with a tutorial  and at each step I would try to find the next step myself before returning to the tutorial to continue onward. In general I found this method very useful because I was able to learn what steps I should have taken to be successful and compare them to the steps I took. Noticeably this helped me realize that some areas I was looking into were rabbit holes that wouldn’t lead anywhere and in some other areas I didn’t search with enough depth. 

# Wednesday:
On Wednesday we had a free for all rather than a scrum, this was useful as by having a smaller group with just as much time you have more of an opportunity to talk and ask questions compared to the scrum where everyone had such a small amount of time that it felt like everyone was talking about the same few things at only a surface level. Luke also presented about the three different kinds of XSS, I found this was really useful as from my work about the owasp top 10 in the first week and also my research about bug bounties and ethical disclosure policies, I knew it was a very common vulnerability that accounts for a large amount of high paying bug bounties.  I learnt about reflected, stored and DOM XSS and also where they would be applicable (such as stored XSS in comment sections). 

Additionally we were assigned the task of breaking into a vulnerable web app and creating a presentation aimed at informing stakeholders about the impact of the vulnerability and how to address it. I decided to break into the http://google-gruyere.appspot.com web app as it has a variety of different attack vectors and also provides technical details about how the issues could be resolved including the specific code that could have been added to the web page. My goal was to try and us a XSS attack as it is a very common and highly damaging attack vector. Additionally it was something that I only recently learned the specifics about and I wanted to challenge myself and use it as an opportunity to learn.

You can find my detailed write up about my steps in finding and exploiting the vulnerability, the impact it has on various stakeholders as well as my testing of how EU institutions protect themselves from XSS attacks here. 
(Testing was done in line with EU CERT Responsible Disclosure Policy)

As I went through I found the inclusion of the specific code examples to be very useful as it further allowed me to understand how the issue was able to happen as well as learning the technical details for how to resolve it which would be very useful in my professional career when I need to provide reports that not only outline the issue but also providing some recommendations to solve it. 

# Thursday:
On Thursday I attempted a new active machine on hack the box called IRKED, I chose to attempt this machine as it was marked as being low difficulty and it was marked high in CVE use and low in custom exploit use. 

Based on my experience with the prior machine I knew that these machines are designed to have an open access point and because of that I started running an nmap scan to find what services were running and I saw that port 80 was running an apache server and another port was running RPC BIND. 

I opened the webpage that the server was running and I saw a message saying that the irc will be running soon as well as an image labeled IRKED. When I opened up the image the URL didn’t indicate the image was stored in any sort of folder so I decided to run Dir buster which attempts to find any folders simply by brute forcing the possible foldernames based on a word list of the most common folder names. Dir buster informed me there were folders and pages such as manual and others that are consistent with an apache server. Unfortunately it didn’t indicate anything else useful.

I then decided to focus my attention on the port running RPC BIND. I began by searching for any references to RPC BIND on exploit-db.com and only found exploits designed to perform denial of service attacks which aren’t suitable as hack the box requires proof of user or root access.

 

I then searched for RPC CTF on duckduckgo and RPC exploits on youtube which provided some results that began by running the rpc info command in order to get more information about what processes were running  and then exploiting a misconfigured NFS server. Unfortunately however when I ran RPC info I didn’t see any indication of an NFS server being run and my research about other attack vectors using RPC and RPC BIND didn’t allow me to progress any further.

Finally I decided to try and see if there could have been some clues hidden within the image file that was hosted on the web server. I ran the file command against the image and was able to confirm it was an image file. I then looked at CTF-Katana hosted by John Hammond (https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana) to see what kind of steganography tools I could use however none of the tools were successfully able to run on my computer.

# Friday:
On Friday we had another free for all rather than a scrum and I likewise found this to be quite useful as I was able to find out what method other students were using to practice and study web pen testing and the difficulties they were having. One of the people in my group for the free for all was talking about how they were working through over the wire’s natas challenges and the issues they’ve been having as they went through the website and I was able to compare their thought process about how they look for the flag with my own and it provided me with some more options or directions for when I next attempt to break into a web site. 

The most notable thing on the Friday was the presentation, I found some difficulty with this as my understanding of what was required in the presentation was different from what I saw the other students presenting. This left me confused and I had to clarify that the direction I was taking my presentation was suitable which thankfully it was. I presented about the XSS vulnerability I found in the http://google-gruyere.appspot.com web app. The presentation was aimed to be very high level with the target audience being stakeholders in the company that lack the deep technical knowledge regarding the architecture of the webapp, its issues or how to fix them. Additionally we were under a very strict 3 minute time limit. This meant that I had to cut down my presentation to include just the most crucial points and to instead focus on the direct impact it could have on the company and its users. I attempted to include technical information regarding the steps it would take to perform an attack in the hopes that this could illustrate just how easy it is and as such how crucial it is that it’s fixed. Unfortunately I feel this part of the presentation was not good as a lot of time was spent explaining some of the technical aspects which could have better been spent further outlining the issues, its scope and just how easy it is for an attacker to find it and exploit it. Some of the feedback I received also indicated that some of the slides contained very little detail which I in hindsight agree with, some of the slides if you just look at them without the additional information from the presentation aren’t understandable which means those slides failed at being informative and instead functioned more like flashcards for what I should talk about. There is a balance between that and simply reading off paragraphs on the slide show which some of my slides were able to meet. 

<bad slide, good slide example>

Additionally on Friday I was unable to attempt IRKED again as when I attempted nmap scans they showed up as unsuccessful despite the webpage opening up again. This issue happened both on the universities network and when connected to a mobile hotspot. The issue was also present after I created a new connection pack. I was using a free connection as was another student with the same issue however when this was attempted on a VIP server by another person in the class they were able to run nmap scans without issue which lead me to believe it was simply an issue with server availability.

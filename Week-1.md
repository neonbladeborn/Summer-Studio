# Introduction: #
I decided to take this subject because I wanted to explore various aspects of penetration testing particularly web based penetration testing as it is one of the largest fields and also something I haven’t got as much knowledge about. I’m hoping that by participating in the studio I will have the direction and knowledge to continue my study and development once the studio is over.  

# Learning contract: #
What do you intend to achieve through the project, including learning goals and tasks to be completed. What will be your contribution to the group effort? What will you learn in that process? What will you produce? You may revise this in subsequent submissions.
I am hoping that by going through with this project I’ll be able to develop my web based penetration skills to the point that I can feel confident with discussing the topic in future at conferences, conventions or meet ups. In addition I also want to develop my skills to the point I can start working on and completing machines on Hack The Box (HTB) as this would give me a great opportunity to improve outside of the studio. I’m hoping that I can contribute my prior experience and knowledge with CTF’s and teaching to help my group with expanding our knowledge, making the studio as positive of an experience as possible and creating any deliverable to a very high quality. In the process I hope to learn and gain experience with teaching and instructing regarding cyber security to people of varying interests, levels of knowledge and understanding which I can then use later in my professional life as I have to teach, instruct and inform various stake holders of complicated issues in cyber security and the way that it impacts them. I hope that by the end of the workshop I will have produced a quality portfolio that will showcase my technical ability as well as my willingness to improve and develop myself.

# 1.Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem: #
On Wednesday there was a presentation by Rob, Rob brought his years of experience working in various parts of the industry to give us a perspective on how the industry has changed over time, the different aspects of cyber security and the way various stake holders look at cyber security and its impact. In particular Rob mentioned how the CIA of cyber security (Confidentiality, Integrity and Accessibility) can vary on their importance depending on the field (eg, power plants need to make sure that integrity is maintained so that the plant can continue to work). Rob additionally provided some examples on tackling cyber security risks, in particular mentioning about how risk can be minimized with acceptance (eg we accept this can cause $100,000 worth of damage because it would cost more than that to fix it) as well as explaining the different language to use to explain cyber security risks to people such as executives, etc (eg, mentioning the impact and how it conflicts/support business goals)

# 2.Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem: #
Unfortunately during this week I don’t feel like I was adequately able to do this as I feel there wasn’t any particularly defined technical problem that I could work on. During this week however I did begin work on my first reflection and I experienced certain difficulties with deciding on the best method of approaching it and formatting it in a way that could adequately address the SLO’s. I decided to remedy this by attempting to break up my reflection into parts that I feel best address each particular SLO, additionally I also decided to accept that as this was my first reflection it is best to submit the highest quality reflection I can and then to look at the feedback I receive to structure future feedback. In coming weeks I aim to challenge myself with finding and addressing technical challenges relevant to the given weeks study, this can include working on Hack the Box, Over the wire and PenTesterLabs.

# 3.Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs: #
During the week we worked on the OWASP juice shop task. I was able to complete some of the challenges including SQL injection, XSS and others. This allowed me to evaluate some of the issues with the design from a security standpoint. The only other work that I did that I would consider to be related to design was the work for the group presentation slides which required us to research technical details however the only design was cosmetic. In future lessons I am hoping to continue to develop my technical skills and analytical skills so that I can develop, model and/or evaluate designs to a high quality

# 4.Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills: #
On Monday when we were assigned groups me and the group I was a part of created a new team on  Microsoft teams where we could collaborate and communicate with each other. On this page we would ask/answer questions and provide feedback for this week’s presentation. Additionally during the week we began work on creating a static website, I was able to get my initial website up and running fairly early on using Github pages and as other people were experiencing issues with setting up their static website I directed them to Github pages and helped them with setting it up. Additionally once I setup my static website I had issues with getting pages to link and display by just pressing text on one of the pages. While helping another student and talking out loud about the process of setting up Github pages I was able to reflect and realize the reason my implementation of linking pages wasn’t working was due to the markdown syntax I was using and my failure to specify the file type as “.md”. After Rob’s presentation on Wednesday I approached him and asked him questions regarding working in the industry and certifications that might be suitable for me, I learned a lot from this and it was able to guide my focus on Friday when we were talking about certifications and career options. Finally on Friday we had our first initial scrum where we were able to reflect and compare to see how we were progressing. During this scrum another student mentioned they were feeling intimidated by certain aspects of the subject/class. Being able to relate to the feeling of being intimidated by the complex field of cyber security I took the opportunity to introduce myself to them at the end of the scrum and told them my name so that if they had any questions or needed help they could message me on teams. I hope that as the weeks go on I can do at least my small part to help other members of my group and others in the class to feel more comfortable, confident and knowledgeable with the field.

# 5.Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation: #
I feel like overall this week I was able to perform at a fairly high quality and I hope that my reflection is of similarly high quality. I am unsure regarding the exact formatting of the reflection and I had made a prior attempt at a reflection that I felt was not adequately addressing the SLO’s and using the knowledge from that I attempted to create this new, improved reflection.

# Group Reflection: # 
The group I was a part of contained people with different areas of interest in penetration testing and different levels of experience and knowledge. We had to take this into account while we were deciding on the topic for and later making the slides for our Wednesday presentation. With this in mind we decided to look at the OWASP top 10 as we felt this was a broad topic that was highly relevant to the studio and also provided a great learning opportunity to myself and others that either didn’t have much knowledge or wanted to improve their knowledge of web based penetration testing and penetration testing as a whole. We began by allocating the list to each of the 5 members of the team. Each person was given two items from the top 10 and because of the varied nature of the list we decided to assign them based on how confident each member of the group was with cyber security and in particular web based security with those who have more experience taking the harder topics and those with less experience taking some of the easier ones. We were able to have the slides finished by Tuesday night and come Wednesday we finalized the introduction and the conclusion. Originally we had planned to write as much detail as we could for Tuesday and then on Wednesday spend some time cutting it down, this however didn’t happen. 

Overall apart from the issues regarding timing I feel we went fairly well with regards to the topic we chose, our communication as a team and our presentation ability.

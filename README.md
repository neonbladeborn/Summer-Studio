This is the home page for my portfolio. Here you can find my weekly reflection detailing my progress week by week through the summer studio as well as a conclusion/Summary that details the main points.

## Conclusion/Summary:
I set a few goals for myself when that I wanted to achieve over the course of the studio and I am happy to say that over the last 4 weeks I have been able to achieve all of them. Firstly I set the goal of being able to break into a hack the box machine as I believe that if I had the ability to break into one of the machines I could then continue to attempt the machines on hack the box as practice to develop my skills outside of the studio. As part of the subject requirements we had to break into one of the HTB machines and I was successfully able to do this and start working on another one. Additionally I joined the summer studio as I wanted an opportunity to develop my skills and feel more confident in my ability and now as the subject is finishing I have started applying for cyber security internships which I wouldn’t have been able to do without first learning the requisite knowledge in the studio. 

### Final Reflective statement:

#### SLO 1: Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
During the summer studio we consistently were required to keep in mind different stakeholder interests. A noteable example of this is the presentation we made that was aimed at C level executives regarding the vulnerability that was found in the vulnerable web app earlier in the week. We had to be consciously aware of the different interests regarding the impact of the vulnerability as well as the different level of technical knowledge that the stakeholders would have as we created our presentation. Additionally we had plenty of opportunities to be exposed to industry professionals notably those from Gitlab and Deloitte that explained how different stake holders interperate and understand (eg, Lose customer information vs fines for breach of privacy) security vulnerabilities. The presentation from Deloitte in particular mentioned how they, as cyber security professionals interacted with executives and other stake holders and the unique challenges this posed. 

#### SLO 2: Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.
I had two notable areas where I heavily applied design thinking, the first one was when I was attacking webapps and machines as part of the weekly deliverables. I found those opportunities very interesting as the way to successfully break into the vulnerable system relied on an improperly designed security implementation and we took advantage of this by first applying design thinking to understand the design of the system which included any potential problem areas and then again to find and test each possible attack vector/problem area. This was one part that I was strongly able to develop as the whole goal of “red teaming” is to help the “blue team” improve and create a better designed and more secure system and I wouldn’t have been so successful with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities if I didn’t have a good ability to apply design thinking. Secondly we also created and maintained a portfolio of our work that contained weekly reflections. In each of these reflections I mentioned and detailed my methodical process in making progress towards achieving my goals of improving my knowledge and solving my problem statement(s)

#### SLO 3: Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs 
Over the course of the studio we were (on multiple occasions) required to demonstrate our technical skill to evaluate how a particular system (webapp, program or VM) is designed. I did this when I attempted to break into the webapps of various EU institutions (This was done legally and in line with EU CERT responsible disclosure policies). While I attempted to break into them I made a number of interesting findings concerning how they implemented their security and by testing multiple angles of attack I was able to model how they designed their web security and as I attempted to break into a variety of institutions I could evaluate the designs comparatively to one another on things such as security and accuracy amongst other criteria. Additionally during the fourth week I learnt about reverse engineering and I put my skills into practice with modeling and evaluating the designs of several different programs as I attempted to find the flags hidden within them. During this week I used the tool  “binary ninja” to model the flow and internal logic of the program as I evaluated it for a possible entry points or location of interest that could reveal the flag.

#### SLO 4: Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.
Every week during the studio there was heavy collaboration and communication required. This goes from the first week where we had our first scrum and I worked with a group of people I had limited prior experience with in order to coordinate and make a presentation on the OWASP top 10 or the second week where we had further scrums and I also presented regarding the vulnerability I found on the web system and communicated its significance and impact on an organisation and additionally in the third week as we started breaking into machines on hack the box I helped some students by providing recommendations on the first machines they should attempt as well as contributing to the free for all’s that replaced the scrums. I also collaborate with people in my group to create a presentation about aircrack and its use in cyber security and finally in the fourth week I collaborate with Andy and Vish to create a presentation regarding our progress in the studio and to then communicate this to anyone we presented to on Friday. 

#### SLO 5: Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation
Throughout the studio I have consistently made sure to evaluate my performance to gauge my progress in completing my intended goals. Additionally for every deliverable I reviewed my work against my standards before I feel comfortable submitting or presenting it. After each deliverable I attempt to get any feedback possible from both the tutors and my peers. For example after my presentation on the vulnerabilities I found on the web app I received verbal feedback that some of my slides were too brief to be effective (ie, the slide didn’t say anything meaningful and required me to expand upon the points to give meaning to it). I acknowledged this and made sure that in my next presentation (about aircrack) I had slides that were more appropriate and I asked for feedback from my peers to confirm that the slide made sense. I also provided earnest feedback to my peers as they were progressing in their work.

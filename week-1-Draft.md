# Reflection:
When it came time for our Wednesday presentation we were allocated 5-6 minutes to present. Unfortunately our presentation went over this time and entered the 13-15 minute range. This was due to me personally writing and including too much detail in the slides I was responsible for presenting as well as the group as a whole choosing a rather lengthy topic and then writing and including additional details in the slides. Originally when we left the class on Monday our plan was to include as much information as we could so that we could then meet up to cut down the content on Wednesday, we weren’t able to have this meet up on Wednesday. Despite the issues with how long the presentation was for I still think the presentation was of a good quality and provided information on an important topic that will prove useful in later weeks as we learn about web based penetration testing.

# Addressing the SLO’s:
During the week I began work on creating my static website that will be used to host my weekly reflections and my portiflio at the end of the studio. I decided on using github pages as I already had prior work on my github account and having the website connected to my prior work could prove valuable outside of the studio. I was able to have the website running initially without much problem and began experimenting and learning how to better use the site. Initially I had issues with linking pages various pages of my website together due to initially finding incorrect information regarding the format of creating a link (text)[website] vs [text](website) and then later neglecting to define the file type as being markdown. Thankfully I was able to resolve this issue after discussing using github pages with other students and then helped some students with setting up their github pages and informed them on my experience with this issue so that they would know what to do to avoid it.

would have let us learn the most (by researching as much detail as we can) while also then keeping the quality of the presentation as high as possible by spending time on Wednesday to cut down the slides to the most important and valuable components. Unfortunately this did not happen. 


On Friday we were given the opportunity to challenge ourselves with a CTF. I found this to have been a very valiable opportunity to test my current level of understanding when it comes to web based penetration testing. During the CTF I was able to solve several challenges including an XSS attack, SQL injection on the login page and additionally editing the POST request on the review page to provide a 0 star review. This was informative and engaging and I was able to then ask other class members for their solutions and find my areas of weakness based on how close or far I was from the correct solution. I then used this information to guide my studies once the class ended.

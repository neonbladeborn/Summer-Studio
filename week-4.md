# Monday:
On Monday we began by having a presentation about reverse engineering. We were taught about how reversing is used particularly with malware analysis and that it’s not something that’s always used in your day to day work however it is still useful as there are certain times and roles where it is important. We then were given several programs which we could use to test and improve our reversing engineering knowledge with. Each of the files contained a “flag” that we had to find and then submit similar to how most CTF’s are organized. I used both binary-ninja and GDB with peda installed. I would first analyze the structure of the program with binary-ninja and then look at the values stored in the registries at various points in GDB. By following this method I was able to find the flag stored in the first two of the programs however on the third program I was unable to find the flag although I did learn a lot about the program itself and I was able to tell that It contained nested if statements where the program would compare the value of one registry to another and if it matched it would allow the program to reveal the flag however if it didn’t then the program would abruptly end. The Interesting thing was that it appeared that it would have to match two conflicting values (eg, it checks if X = 1 and then a little latter if x = 2). I attempted to pass those conditions by changing the registry values partway through the program and using this I was able to bypass the first check however beyond that no attempt was able to let me go further.

# Wednesday:
On Wednesday we had a final clarification regarding the necessary items for the final submission and additionally we were given time to work together as we developed our skills and worked on our projects. I used this time to attempt to break into the teacher box on HTB and while I wasn’t able to get the user or root flag I learnt a lot and it gave me an opportunity to test my knowledge and compare it to my progress when I first attempted a HTB machine and while I attempted this newest box I noticed that I had a lot more steps or angles of attack I could go after before I started searching online for new methods. Additionally I helped some of the other students with breaking into their own HTB machines by occasionally providing small hints. Seeing other students complete the same box I was working on was very interesting as some of the parts I thought were simple or easy to solve the other students had more difficulty with and it was interesting to see how they approached the problems. 

# Thursday:
I spent time on Thursday focusing on my presentation for Friday. I found some difficulty doing this as it can be hard to show the progress I have made in just a few short minutes as people are passing and additionally unlike other subjects or studios, we didn’t have a single core creation that we worked on that can be put on the desk to show and explain to visitors. In the end I decided to pivot my presentation around the fact that I went from a rather basic knowledge of cyber security to beginning to apply for internships in the cyber security industry and I attribute my ability to do this to what I learnt in the summer studio.

# Friday:
Friday was the day of the presentation and I paired with Andy and Vish to present as a group with me introducing and talking about some of the things that happened (presentations by people from industry, etc) as well as what I achieved during the subject. Vish then mentioned more about what was required from us in the weekly submissions and provided examples of the tools and techniques we learnt and finally Andy talked about bug bounty programs on places like bug crowd. I feel like this method was the best as we didn’t have to pad out our content and we could offer a more meaningful presentation and conversation to those that we presented to. Overall this week I feel like I was able to make some good quality work although I similarly feel that I started to experience a lot of burn out and found it at times difficult to focus and continue working during this week. However, despite feeling some burn out I continued working and I still learnt a lot.

# Monday:
On Monday we clarified the content that we had covered throughout the last two weeks. We were also assigned the task of creating a presentation about one of the tools that are commonly used by ethical hackers. My group chose to present about the aircrack-ng suite of tools. We felt this would be a good idea as 
It is something that is very practical and important to know but also not used often in HTB machines or CTF’s. Among our group of four we split the task to include airodump, airreplay, airckrack and the intro + example. As a group we decided to stay behind later on Monday in order to spend some time working on the presentation. I’m glad that we were able to spend the time after class working on the presentation since because we were all together we could easily clarify the various parts of the presentation such as the use of different tools in the aircrack suite and which of them we should mention. We were also a little confused regarding the intended audience for the presentation and whether it should be technical and teach how to use the tool or if it should be more high level and targeted to executives and other stakeholders and by staying behind we could clarify those questions and make sure that our presentation meet the requirements. 


# Wednesday:
On Wednesday we had a presentation by Deloitte were they talked about the industry and the work they perform as pen testers. I found this very insightful as two of the presenters had entered the field from a graduate role and their entry into the industry closely mirrored how I plan on starting my first role.  Additionally they mentioned the workplace culture, how their roles vary and the expected workday.  After they finished presenting about what their work is like they provided us with a vulnerable machine to try and break into. Unfortunately I was unable to get the machine running on my computer so I worked with another class member to try and break into the box. Like most people in the class we ended up getting stuck with the heart bleed vulnerability and the nmap scan not finding the nginx service running on 4949 however once Deloitte showed us the heart bleed vulnerability we were able to access the login page. After the presentation by Deloitte I had the opportunity to ask them some questions including how they could tell if they were going down a rabbit hole as well as if different people in their teams had certain specializations or if everyone was more generalized. Because of this I learnt that with more experience I will be able to better tell if I’m progressing down a rabit hole and that most members of the team had some specializations but they were expected to have a general knowledge and that the specializations develop further as they work. Towards the end of the class we began our own presentation. Overall I think it went quite well. We were able to teach the class about the different aspects of air crack and how each of them would be contribute to performing an attack. The only issues we had were some small technical issues with getting the computer set up to present and the fact that not everyone in the class would be familiar with networking and in particular the handshakes used to connect to a wifi network. Our steps to resolve the issue of network knowledge was to try and keep the presentation slightly higher level and to mention those aspects in such a way that the context of the slide/presentation will make it understandable.

Finally, on Wednesday I was also able to break into the curly vulnerable machine on HTB. I did this firstly to meet the deliverable requirements for Friday but also because I had outlined it as one of my goals for what I wanted to get out of the studio. Last week I was unable to crack any of the boxes and I wanted to try a new box and also to see if I am able to make any more progress after my study and work this week. You can find my write-up regarding how I was able to do so here: <Link available once the box is retired, was submitted as PDF on uts online>

# Thursday:
Earlier in the week we were given the amazing opportunity to test a real life web app to develop our technical skills and experience the process of working within the scope of a bug bounty and submitting appropriately detailed and informative bug reports in line with an ethical disclosure policy. Our Friday deliverable required us to either break into one of the active machines on hack the box or find a vulnerability on the web app. As was mentioned prior I was able to successfully break into one of the machines on hack the box so I decided that I would spend Thursday attempting to test for vulnerabilities on the web app. After spending some time on the web app and investigating various areas I was able to find a vulnerability and I disclosed it in line with the ethical disclosure policy of the web app. Due to the responsible disclosure policy of the web app I am unable to disclose its name or the vulnerability that was found. 


# Friday:
On Friday we had another free for all which I found very insightful and informative; I was able to compare myself to the progress of other students to find if I’m making good progress or if I need to put in more time and I also was able to see how they were practicing and developing their skills which gave me some more direction regarding where to go to continue learning. I had the opportunity to discuss my progress in the studio with the tutors and I received some very valuable feedback concerning my presentation and the depth of detail used. We also had Jai and Jason share how they were able to break into the Deloitte piper vulnerable box. I found learning how they broke into the box interesting as it seemed that Jason and Jai had found two slightly different methods and I also learnt that things such as python 1 liners exist and some of the methods for privilege escalation.

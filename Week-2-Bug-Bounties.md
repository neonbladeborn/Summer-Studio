# Bug bounties and ethical disclosure policies
Ethical hacking (and penetration testing) are an important part of cyber security, It gives companies and other organizations the opportunity to test their system under real world conditions. One of the most common methods for a company to test their system is using bug bounties implementing responsible disclosure policies. This is where companies place a monetary bounty on any bugs/vulnerabilities that people find and then disclose in line with their responsible disclosure policy, these bug bounties typically contain a scope outlining what ethical hackers can legally test on. An example of the responsible disclosure policy is that put in place by CERT-EU which requires an ethical hacker to disclose any vulnerability they find by sending them an email that’s protected using PGP and to have not disclosed it to anyone else prior. Additionally CERT-EU specifies the scope of the bug bounty and while it doesn’t provide a financial incentive it does maintain a list of all those who’ve found vulnerabilities to provide credit and recognition. Prior to having ethical hackers test their system (bug bounties or other methods) companies will have their own internal testing to find as many bugs as they can. However often times this testing is done by the development team rather than people with a focus on cyber security, because of that the testing ends up being much more centered on design and functionality. Additionally as it is internal testing those who do the testing will often already have assumptions regarding the software that could limit their ability to find vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers are focused on cyber security and bring an outside perspective that can be useful in finding vulnerabilities that were overlooked. The scopes in bug bounties are designed to outline what the company wants tested, this can include only testing recent software/hardware rather than old no longer supported software/hardware or removing sensitive areas of a companies network or website from the scope in order to reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure.
